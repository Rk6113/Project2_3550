This project is a secure JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server designed to enhance authentication processes in modern applications. It utilizes Flask as the web framework and SQLite for backend storage of private keys, ensuring that keys are persisted safely on disk. The server provides endpoints to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using RSA private keys stored in the database, allowing for secure user authentication. Additionally, it serves JWKS in a standardized format, enabling clients to easily retrieve public keys to verify JWT signatures. By implementing robust security measures and adhering to best practices, this project aims to safeguard sensitive data against common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks, while maintaining a seamless user experience.
