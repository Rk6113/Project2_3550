I recently set up my project environment on my Mac by installing Python 3 and Flask. After getting everything configured, I modified the main.py file to enhance its functionality and security features. Once the updates were complete, I put the application through its paces by testing it with the Gradebot. The testing process not only helped me ensure that everything was working smoothly but also gave me valuable insights into areas that needed improvement. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of the development process and reinforced my coding skills.
